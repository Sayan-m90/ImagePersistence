extractall.sh:
Takes each image in the folder 256_ObjectCategories and generate their topological signature in stat.csv
To use:
1. Keep the script and folder 256_OnjectCategories in the same folder.
2. Change parameters in line 10 as necessary for other datasets.
3. Run  ./extractall.sh

/**********************************************************************************************************************/

caltech.sh: Given the Dataset CalTech-256, generates topological feature of all images and stores it in a csv file.
Run on any GNU shellscript
To Run:
1. Keep in a folder with Caltech-256 Dataset. and the software pers. 
2. Run using ./caltech.sh
3. Outputs stat.csv containing topological signature for each image.


/**********************************************************************************************************************/

caltech.m: Given the input stat.csv, classify the last topological vector in the csv file. If images are supplied, then classifies based on Fisher Vector as well.
To Run:
1. Install VLFEAT http://www.vlfeat.org/install-matlab.html to use Fisher Vector
2. Run the script in matlab
3. Supply input .csv file and image folder as asked for.
